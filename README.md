# This is how you gonna contribute to this project
- First you gonna need to fork it to create a copy of this project onto your local machine
- Then you create a pull request which will be visible to the owner of this project
- After all he will see your pull request and may check and merge it

## this is from my other account 
- First I cloned project from Git Desktop or fork from website
- Then I created a new branches in pull request
- I published the branch and chose for contribution option (this made the branch visible to the owner)
- I made code and then commited it to this branch (not gonna work on the main branch)
- (Important move) I need to open my forked repo on website and compare and pull request (this is the final part to publish the branch visibly to the owner)
- Owner saw the public branch and had a glance at it then when its good he merge the pull request to his main branch
